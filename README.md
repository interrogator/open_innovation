# Open innovation: bibliography and other open utils

At Ã–AW, and in the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities, we work on open innovation, and cover a lot of interdisplcinary ground. It seems sensible that we have access to a shared bibliography, and there's no reason at all why it can't be public.

In case we aren't all familiar with `git` and `github`, this repository can also serve as a gentle introduction to this technology

## `.bib` format

`.bib`, as used in `TeX`, is the natural choice of format, since it is open-source, and can easily be imported into popular tools. It is machine-readable and can be outputted in many different reference styles.

## Contributing

The workflow for `git` can be complex, but the steps involved ensure that documents are kept under version control, and the contributions made by an individual are logged.

A basic outline:

```
# make a local copy of the repo
git clone 
# create a new branch, derived from master
git checkout
# modify references using text editor
# add the changes to git
git add 
# commit changes to history
# upload the branch to master
# git push origin master
```

Once you've pushed, come to this website and make a `Pull request`!
